A brilliant bit of code that hopefully works
I ran out of time to do this properly, which I hate as I like to only submit awesomeness.

The single function 'run_analysis' does the following:
 - downloads zip
 - extracts data sets from appropriate locations on zip
 - gets column information from another file (also in zip)
 - merges data sets
 - works through project requirements
 - only non-standard libaray used is the 'reshape2'; this is to use the 'melt' function

Thanks!
